# 📸 OCR Receipt Scanner - Integration Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Backend Components

#### **1. OCR Service** (`server/services/ocrService.js`)
- **Image Preprocessing**: Uses Sharp to enhance image quality
  - Grayscale conversion
  - Contrast normalization
  - Image sharpening
- **Text Extraction**: Tesseract.js OCR engine
  - Multi-language support (default: English)
  - Progress tracking
  - Confidence scoring
- **Data Parsing**: Intelligent expense data extraction
  - Amount detection (multiple formats)
  - Currency identification
  - Date extraction (various formats)
  - Merchant name detection
  - Category auto-detection based on keywords
  - Raw text preservation

#### **2. File Upload Configuration** (`server/config/multer.js`)
- Multer middleware for file handling
- Image-only filter (jpeg, jpg, png, gif, bmp, tiff, webp)
- 10MB file size limit
- Unique filename generation
- Automatic uploads directory creation

#### **3. OCR Routes** (`server/routes/ocr.js`)
- `POST /api/ocr/scan` - Scan receipt and extract data
- `POST /api/ocr/upload-receipt` - Upload and link to expense
- `GET /api/ocr/receipts/:expenseId` - Get all receipts for expense
- `DELETE /api/ocr/receipts/:receiptId` - Delete receipt

---

### Frontend Components

#### **1. Receipt Scanner Component** (`src/components/expenses/ReceiptScanner.tsx`)
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Image preview
- Real-time OCR processing
- Extracted data display with confidence meter
- Auto-fill expense form
- Beautiful UI with loading states

#### **2. Updated Submit Expense Page** (`src/pages/expenses/SubmitExpense.tsx`)
- Integrated OCR scanner button
- Auto-fill form with extracted data
- Seamless user experience

#### **3. API Service** (`src/services/api.ts`)
- `ocrAPI.scanReceipt()` - Scan receipt
- `ocrAPI.uploadReceipt()` - Upload with optional expense link
- `ocrAPI.getReceipts()` - Fetch receipts
- `ocrAPI.deleteReceipt()` - Remove receipt

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### User Flow:

1. **User clicks "OCR Scan" button** on Submit Expense page
2. **Receipt Scanner modal opens**
3. **User uploads receipt image** (drag-drop or click)
4. **Image preview displayed**
5. **User clicks "Scan Receipt"**
6. **Backend processes image:**
   - Preprocesses with Sharp (grayscale, normalize, sharpen)
   - Extracts text with Tesseract.js
   - Parses expense data (amount, currency, date, merchant, category)
7. **Extracted data displayed** with confidence score
8. **User clicks "Use This Data"**
9. **Form auto-fills** with extracted information
10. **User reviews and submits expense**

## 📦 Dependencies Added

### Backend (`server/package.json`):
```json
{
  "multer": "^1.4.5-lts.1",      // File upload handling
  "tesseract.js": "^5.0.4",      // OCR engine
  "sharp": "^0.33.2"             // Image preprocessing
}
```

### Installation:
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

---

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install multer tesseract.js sharp
```

### 2. Create Uploads Directory
The server automatically creates the `uploads` directory, but you can create it manually:
```bash
mkdir server/uploads
```

### 3. Update .gitignore
Add to `.gitignore`:
```
server/uploads/*
!server/uploads/.gitkeep
```

### 4. Start Servers
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd expense-manager
npm run dev
```

SELECT * FROM expense_receipts;

-- Check OCR data
SELECT receipt_id, file_url, 
       JSON_EXTRACT(ocr_data, '$.amount') as amount,
       JSON_EXTRACT(ocr_data, '$.currency') as currency

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Failed to process receipt"
**Solutions:**
1. Check image quality (not blurry)
2. Ensure good lighting in photo
3. Try preprocessing image manually
4. Check server logs for details

### Issue: Low confidence score
**Solutions:**
1. Use higher resolution image
2. Ensure receipt is flat (not wrinkled)
3. Good contrast between text and background
4. Try scanning again with better image

### Issue: Amount not detected
**Solutions:**
1. Ensure amount is clearly visible
2. Check if amount has currency symbol
3. Look for "Total" or "Amount" labels
4. Manually enter if OCR fails

### Issue: Upload fails
**Solutions:**
1. Check file size (< 10MB)
2. Verify file type (image only)
3. Check backend is running
4. Verify uploads directory exists
