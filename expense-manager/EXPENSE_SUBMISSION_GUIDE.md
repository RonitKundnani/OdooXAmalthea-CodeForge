# 💰 Expense Submission - Complete Guide

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Backend (Already exists)
- `POST /api/expenses` - Create expense in database
- Validates input data
- Stores in `expenses` table
- Creates audit log entry
- Returns expense ID

### Frontend (Just Updated)
- Form validation (amount, date, category required)
- Submit button with loading state
- Success/error message display
- Receipt file upload
- OCR integration
- Auto-redirect to history after submission
- Database integration

---

## 🚀 How It Works

### Complete Flow:

1. **User fills form** (or uses OCR to auto-fill)
   - Amount (required)
   - Currency (default: USD)
   - Category (required)
   - Date (required)
   - Description (optional)
   - Receipt image (optional)

2. **User clicks "Submit Expense"**
   - Frontend validates form
   - Shows validation errors if any

3. **Frontend sends POST request** to `/api/expenses`
   ```json
   {
     "amount": 45.50,
     "currencyCode": "USD",
     "category": "Meals",
     "description": "Team lunch",
     "expenseDate": "2024-10-04"
   }
   ```

4. **Backend creates expense**
   - Inserts into `expenses` table
   - Sets status to 'pending'
   - Links to user and company
   - Returns expense ID

5. **If receipt uploaded**
   - Frontend uploads receipt to `/api/ocr/upload-receipt`
   - Backend processes with OCR
   - Stores in `expense_receipts` table
   - Links to expense

6. **Success!**
   - Shows success message
   - Redirects to expense history
   - Expense visible in dashboard

### Check Expenses with Receipts:
```sql
SELECT 
  e.expense_id,
  e.amount_original,
  e.category,
  er.file_url,
  JSON_EXTRACT(er.ocr_data, '$.amount') as ocr_amount,

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Submit button does nothing

**Check:**
1. Form validation - are all required fields filled?
2. Browser console - any errors?
3. Network tab - is request being sent?
4. Backend logs - is server receiving request?

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Open browser console (F12)
// Look for validation errors or network errors
```

### Issue: "Failed to submit expense"

**Possible causes:**
1. Backend not running
2. Not logged in (token expired)
3. Database connection issue
4. Validation error

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:5000/health

# Check you're logged in
# Browser console: localStorage.getItem('token')

# Restart backend
cd server
npm run dev
```

### Issue: Expense created but receipt not uploaded

**Possible causes:**
1. File too large (>10MB)
2. Invalid file type
3. OCR processing failed

**Solution:**
- Check file size and type
- Check backend logs for OCR errors
- Receipt upload is optional - expense still created

### Issue: Validation errors not showing

**Check:**
- Form has `<form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>`
- Submit button has `type="submit"`
- Validation function is called
- Errors state is being set
