## 🔒 Security Features

### Password Security:
```javascript
// Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds)
const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt(10);
const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);
```

### Email Validation:
- Checks for existing email before creation
- Prevents duplicate accounts
- Email cannot be changed after creation

### Role-Based Access:
- Only admins can access user management
- Protected routes on frontend and backend
- JWT token verification on all requests

### Self-Protection:

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: "User with this email already exists"
**Solution:** Email must be unique. Use a different email address.

### Issue: "Access denied"
**Solution:** Only admins can manage users. Login with admin account.

### Issue: "Cannot delete your own account"
**Solution:** This is by design. Have another admin delete your account if needed.

### Issue: "Password must be at least 6 characters"
**Solution:** Use a longer password (minimum 6 characters).

### Issue: Users not loading
**Solution:** 
1. Check backend is running
2. Check you're logged in as admin
3. Check browser console for errors
4. Verify database connection
